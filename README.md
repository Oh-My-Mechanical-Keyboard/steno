# Steno

This repo contains everything I designed and implemented that's related to stenography. You can find the PCB files for my steno keyboard in the `pcb/` directory, and the custom steno firmware and the dictionary compiler in the `qmk/` and `compiler/` directories.

Check out the [boards](pcb/README.md) and the [firmware](qmk/README.md) ([dictionary compiler](compiler/README.md) needed).
